    "description": "Crafting the Web: A Glimpse Into My Journey as a Software Web Engineer<br/><br/>Over <strong style='color:#A290FC'>5++</strong> years, I’ve had the privilege of working on transformative web solutions that merge technology with real-world impact. As a software web engineer, I’ve honed my skills in React.JS, Vue.JS, Next.JS, Node.JS, Firebase, GCP and AWS to develop scalable, user-centric applications.<br/><br/>One of my proudest achievements was when i managed 25-30 people in AI Department of Bank BRI (one of the largest bank in Indonesia, also serve application that accessed by 100.000++ users among in Indonesia. Collaborating with cross-functional teams, I learned the value of combining technical expertise with communication and problem-solving.<br/><br/>What drives me most is the ever-evolving nature of this industry. From optimizing code for performance to staying ahead with modern tools like Next.JS, Nest.JS, Cloud Platform (GCP, AWS, Firebase), I enjoy pushing the boundaries of what’s possible on the web.<br/><br/>If you're passionate about software engineering, have questions, or want to connect, feel free to reach out! Let’s build something amazing together."
